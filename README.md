# Work-Day-Scheduler
This repository (Work-Day-Scheduler) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with jQuery, moment.js and using containers, rows and columns. We were tasked with finishing the code for a day planner, where each hour can save and store data to the locol storage. 
The moment.js was used to display the date and time on the planner right up to the very second.

#What I learnt 
This assignment was not supposed to be as hard as the assessment quiz, however it did prove to be difficult in its own way. The hardest part for me was the html. I spent many hours looking over the bootstrap requirements for the html. I read over the course assigned reading and it just wasn't sinking in for some reason. I decided to start the html and for some reason didnt pay attention to the css. I had to go back and change the css selectors so they matched the html. I did this will all of them and once I was finished my calander didnt look quite right. Everything was in the right place and the spacing was fine in the containers. However, there was space or padding between each time-block that made it look just slightly different than the example provided. I was going to leave and have one of the ta's help decifer my errors, but I just wasnt happy cause I had changed all the selectors and it had become to confusing. 
I started all over again and created a new div and copied/pasted the new ones and found I still had an issue. Even though I had fixed the issue with to much space between the time-blocks. I had created a new one where the description area or the textarea was maybe 50px long. I decided to ask one of the ta's for assistance as I knew I was missing in the html but I couldnt put my finger on it. Turns out, I was missing the spacing for the columns and rows. This was easily fixed and I later corrected them all to reflect the changes. 
I went over the bootstrap layout and utilies section again and have a better understanding for column spacing and responsive design. The activities in the course were way to fast for me and I didn't understand them properly after I went back and taught them to myself. 
There is just so much information to absorb in this course and what we did in 10 minutes as an activity could have been an hour long lecture.
I have become more comfortible with the functions in the javascript. However, I still need guidence with the formation of the functions. Being that I wasn't able to meet up with tutor to help guide me in the right direction and I didn't want to waste hours trying to figure it out on my own. I decided to search the internet for direction and found help on github. This saved me time I didn't have because the last assignment left me behind on my readings and activities and it showed in this assignment when I had hard time with spacing the bootstrap columns.
