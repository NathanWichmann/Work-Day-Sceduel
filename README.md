# Work-Day-Scheduler
This repository (Work-Day-Scheduler) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with jQuery, moment.js and using containers, rows and columns. We were tasked with finishing the code for a day planner, where each hour can save and store data to the locol storage. 
The moment.js was used to display the date and time on the planner right up to the very second.
